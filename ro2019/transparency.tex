\section{Transparency}\label{sec-transparency}

In this paper we argue that the dimension of reproducibility most ripe
for the contributions of computer science is research
\emph{transparency}, in particular through the modeling, recording,
and querying of the \emph{provenance} of research artifacts.  In
alignment with researchers in the natural sciences who recognize
transparency as crucial, we are confident that provenance management
has much to contribute to scientific reproducibility, even when it
does not specifically enable exact repeatability of the computations
they describe.

For provenance management systems, representations, and user interfaces to support reproducibility via transparency,
	however, they must support \emph{science-oriented queries}.
That is, provenance must be able to answer questions about the \emph{science} that was performed---not just the
	sequence, dependencies, and flow of data through computational steps.
The answers to these questions must enable others to evaluate the scientific quality of the work, and to learn what is necessary to
	reproduce the results \emph{without} actually repeating every step taken in the original work.
Provenance must enable researchers to build on the results and processes reported in prior work with confidence.

Finally, it must be possible for researchers unversed in the detailed
specifications of Research Objects and the PROV
standard~\cite{groth2013provoverviewa} to pose questions and receive
answers meaningful for evaluating, using, and building on the
processes and products of prior research.  We suggest that ROs and
related approaches are the ideal vehicle for storing, sharing and
making provenance queryable in this way.  Research Objects thus can
support scientific reproducibility even in the face of the many
practical challenges to computational repeatability.
