  abstract = {Scientific workflow management systems offer features for composing complex computational pipelines from modular building blocks, executing the resulting automated workflows, and recording the provenance of data products resulting from workflow runs. Despite the advantages such features provide, many automated workflows continue to be implemented and executed outside of scientific workflow systems due to the convenience and familiarity of scripting languages (such as Perl, Python, R, and MATLAB), and to the high productivity many scientists experience when using these languages. YesWorkflow is a set of software tools that aim to provide such users of scripting languages with many of the benefits of scientific workflow systems. YesWorkflow requires neither the use of a workflow engine nor the overhead of adapting code to run effectively in such a system. Instead, YesWorkflow enables scientists to annotate existing scripts with special comments that reveal the computational modules and dataflows otherwise implicit in these scripts. YesWorkflow tools extract and analyze these comments, represent the scripts in terms of entities based on the typical scientific workflow model, and provide graphical renderings of this workflow-like view of the scripts. Future version of YesWorkflow will also allow the prospective provenance of the data products of these scripts to be queried in ways similar to those available to users of scientific workflow systems.},

This envisioned coupling of data and process is essential to advancing science but faces technical and institutional barriers. The Whole Tale~project aims to address these barriers by connecting computational, data-intensive research efforts with the larger research process\textemdash{}transforming the knowledge discovery and dissemination process into one where data products are united with research articles to create ``living publications'' or tales. The Whole Tale~focuses on the full spectrum of science, empowering users in the long tail of science, and power users with demands for access to big data and compute resources. We report here on the design, architecture, and implementation of the Whole Tale~environment.},

It is easy to assume that computational methods self-document by their very nature of being exact, deterministic processes. However, similar to laboratory experiments, ensuring reproducibility in the computational realm requires the documentation of both the protocols used (workflows), as well as a detailed description of the computational environment: algorithms, implementations, software environments, and the data ingested and execution logs of the computation. These two aspects of computational reproducibility (workflows and execution details) are discussed within the context of biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (bioNMR), as well as the PRIMAD model for computational reproducibility.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
