\section{Outline of paper}
In the remainder of this paper we briefly discuss four topics we plan to investigate
	in the course of the Whole Tale project.
In Section 3 we review the general notion of reproducibility in science, and in Section 4
	highlight how digital computing in principle makes possible a completely new kind of reproducibility: 
	\emph{exact repeatability}. 
We emphasize that the notion of \emph{transparency}---long a critical element of
	reproducibillity in the pure natural sciences---has a role to play even for those computational components
	of research where exact repeatability is feasible.
In Section 5 we provide an overview of several dimensions of the terminological debate around reproducibility
	generally, and propose that a pluralistic approach to defining key terms is essential if a general 
	concept of reproducibility is to be shared across disciplines.
In Section 6 we summarize a number of limitations on exact repeatability in practice, and in Section 7 
	show how science-oriented provenance queries can mitigate such limitations by maintaining
 	the transparency most essential to reproducibility in science.
Throughout, we highlight the role that Research Objects can serve in supporting and maintaining 
	reproducibility by encapsulating the information needed to rerun the computational steps
	in a study, and by enabling transparency via queries of provenance information
	packaged in the object.
