\section{Terminology}

Despite broad acceptance of the importance of general idea of reproducibility sciences, 
	recent years have seen a growing debate over the precise meanings of the terms
	\emph{reproducible} and \emph{replicable}, and the relationship between the two.
For example, should one term imply a greater adherence to the procedures and methods employed
	in the original research?
Should one term be reserved for the activities a researcher performs to assess the reliability of their own procedures, 
	experiments, and results; leaving the other term to refer to activities centered on assessing the quality of 
	the results of others?  
Which term should be used to mean what? And what value is there in distinguishing reproducibility from replicability
	at all?

As an example of an effort to distinguish reproducibility and replicability the FASEB recommendations are illuminating:

	Replicability: the ability to duplicate (i.e., repeat) a prior result using the same
	source materials and methodologies. This term should only be used when
	referring to repeating the results of a specific experiment rather than an
	entire study.

	Reproducibility: the ability to achieve similar or nearly identical results using comparable materials and methodologies. 
	This term may be used when specific findings from a study are obtained by an independent group of researchers

Footnote: The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology comprises twenty-nine distinct scientific 
	societies together representing over 105,000 practicing researchers.

According to these definitions, \emph{replicability} indicates a higher level of fidelity than does \emph{reproducibility}, 
	both with respect to the prior result to be confirmed, and to the materials and methodologies employed.
Replicability also appears more likely for the original researchers (they presumably have access to the "same source materials"
	and are in the best position to use the same methologies), whereas reproducibility is considered feasible for
	"an independent group of researchers". 



Neither definition refers specifically to computed results and both apply to experimental results.  In contrast, the recent report from the National
	Academy of Sciences reverses the relative fidelity implied by the terms 'reproducibility' and 'replicability':

Reproducibility is obtaining consistent results using the same input data, computational
	steps, methods, and code, and conditions of analysis. 

Replicability is obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same
	scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data.


Perhaps most intriguing about the NAS definitions is that experiments not carried out entirely in silico apparently are left with only term
	to describe them: replicability. Satisfying the definition of reproducibility requires "computational steps" and "code", and  
	the report goes on to clarify that reproducibility "is synonymous with 'computational reproducibility,' and the terms are
	used interchangeably in this report."

FASEB also defines transparency in a manner consistent with our usage here:

	Transparency:  the reporting of experimental materials and methods in a manner that provides enough information 
	for others to independently assess and/or reproduce experimental findings

In contrast, the NAS report essentially makes reproducibility a prerequisite of transparency: "When a researcher transparently
	reports a study and makes available the underlying digital artifacts, such as data and code, the results should be 
	computationally reproducible."   

We take the position that it transparency is essential to science, whereas reproducibility as defined by the NAS is not necessarily possible, as detailed below.

Footnote or note at end of paper:

		Cell and molecular biologists study both replication and reproduction as natural processes.
		DNA replicates :  high fidelity, variation not desired, ingredients indistiguishable, errors are corrected on the fly.
		Organisms reproduce:  lower fidelity expected, variation desired, different ingredients acceptable.
		Cells have replisomes, complex molecular machines where DNA replication occurs, and copying errors are detected and corrected.
		In origin of life research a crucial debate is over 'replication first' (DNA World) or
 					'metabolism first' (aka reproduction first, i.e. without replicating genetic material).
		These terminologies with biology are well established.
		Biologists also have a rich and well-defined vocabulary to describe replicability of experimental measurements and results.
		Commonly distinguish two kinds of experimental 'replicates':  technical replicates, and biological replicates.
 			Reality is that the terminology is well established in large branches of science already.

	Need for reproduction/replication to mean different things in different fields

		The relationships of corresponding concepts across fields is one of analogy, not identity.
		Exact repeatability is at least theoretically possible and sometimes practical under realistic assumptions when an experiment
			is entirely in silico and isolated from the outside world.
		As soon as observation of the real world is involved, exact repeatability often is impossible.
		Neither of the types of replicates in experimental biology are exact, although both are measures of repeatability.
		There often is no way to repeat exactly an experiment that involves scientific instruments, physical samples, or experimental apparatus.
		In contrast, it is not unreasonable to talk about exactly repeating a purely computational experiment, at least by the original researcher,
			on the same hardware, close in time to the original experiment.
		In reality, computational repeatability is not as easy as sometimes assumed (see below), but fundamentally this is
			a different situation than when a scientific instrument is involved or observations are made of the external world.

	Our approach to terminology

		Respect differences between fields of research and different expectations with regard to reproducibility.
		Do not expect standardization to even be meaningful (never mind politically achievable) across domains.
		Instead, only use the R* words in ways that make their meanings clear in context.
		Do not be surprised if computational sciences turn out not to be representative of science generally.

	Specific implications for our contributions to the Research Objects field

		Take care to define R* words precisely when expressing desiderata, describing features, or making or comparing claims about capabilities.
		Do not expect efforts to achieve computational repeatability alone to enable "reproducible science" generally.

As alluded to in the introduction, the entry of digitial computing into scientific research
	has further complicated these issues somewhat by introducing the possibility of exact repeatability.
For the purposes of this paper we will continue to reserve the terms reproducibility and replicability to
	qualities demanded of scientific research whether digital computers are involved or not.
We use the term repeatability to refer to quality of computations that is desirable so far as computers are involved
	in research, but do not consider repeatability in this sense to be a prerequisite of reproducibility or
	replicability even when computers are used in research.
