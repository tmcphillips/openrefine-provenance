## 2019-06-15 List points to make in RO2019 paper

### Background
- Considering submitting a paper to [Research Objects 2019](https://researchobject.github.io/ro2019/) workshop.
- Would like to use this as an opportunity to:
	- Make the case for *transparency* being the ultimate goal of provenance and reproducibility.
	- Highlight *researchers* as the most important users of research objects. 
	- Clearly distinguish requirements on research object *functions* from research object *attributes*.
	- Provide an easy to understand *model of scientific research projects* that illustrates the importance of *provenance queries*.
	- Advance our data cleaning provenance research.
