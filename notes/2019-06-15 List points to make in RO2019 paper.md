## 2019-06-15 List points to make in RO2019 paper

### Background
- Considering submitting a paper to [Research Objects 2019](https://researchobject.github.io/ro2019/) workshop.
- 
- Would like to use this as an opportunity to:
	
	- Make the case for *transparency* being the ultimate goal of provenance and reproducibility.
	
	- Highlight *researchers* as the most important users of research objects. 
	
	- Clearly distinguish requirements on research object *functions* from research object *attributes*.
	
	- Provide an easy to understand *model of scientific research projects* that illustrates the importance of *provenance queries*.
	
	- Advance our data cleaning provenance research.

### Strategy for achieving paper aims

- The main point to make is that research objects generally, and particularly their retrospective provenance capabilities, must support researchers who make use of the research objects *as researchers*.
  
- Focus on high-level requirements--not just ‘desiderata’ but also ‘sine qua nons’, i.e. requirements so important that “research” objects without them should not actually be considered research objects.

- Use *queries* (prospective as well as prospective) about data cleaning workflows to illustrate the kinds of transparency-supporting, science-oriented questions we believe research objects need to support.  

- Avoid emphasizing implementation details of research objects, specific ontologies, etc.  
  
- Rather than dive into the details of a particular science domain, use _data cleaning_ as a metaphor or model ("spherical cow") for scientific research generally.
  
- Point out that data cleaning is a crucial component in much scientific research and thus represents an aspect of research that cannot be ignored.

- Cite Brent Mishler who stated that his group’s projects often comprise a year of (biodiversity) data integration and cleaning, culminating in a day of data analysis.

- Pose the question:  If more than 99% of the work in a research project is data collection, integration, and cleaning and this part of the research workflow is opaque-- should we really the trust the ultimate analysis?  
  
- Do not spend time on integrating with OpenRefine yet. Simply model some illustrative data sets and data cleaning workflows, and get useful queries of interest to domain researchers work for these examples.
